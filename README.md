# Console-Finances

## Description

Website where javascript code that anaylses records to help calculate; total numbers of months in the records, net amount of total profit/losses, average change in profit/losses from month to month and then the average, the month with the greatest profit and the month with the greatest loss. To access the information user needs to go into developer tools to see the output in console. See in below image:


Project was built to increase my understanding of using for loops, arrays and nested arrays. I have also implimented let and const instead of var with further research as to why. There is also concating of strings and numbers to return arrays.

## Usage

Open webpage and right click to "Inspect" page, click on console and you will be able to see output.
